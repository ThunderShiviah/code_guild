Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of <a href=\"/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets\" title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\">CSS</a>. Many of the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537 <i>Techniques for using SGML</i>, which in turn covers the features of early text formatting languages such as that used by the <a href=\"/wiki/TYPSET_and_RUNOFF\" title=\"TYPSET and RUNOFF\">RUNOFF command</a> developed in the early 1960s for the <a href=\"/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System\" title=\"Compatible Time-Sharing System\">CTSS</a> (Compatible Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and markup; HTML has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.</p>\n",

    "<p>Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was formally defined as such by the <a href=\"/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force\" title=\"Internet Engineering Task Force\">Internet Engineering Task Force</a> (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an HTML specification: <a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"external text\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01.txt\">\"Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)\" Internet-Draft</a> by Berners-Lee and <a href=\"/wiki/Dan_Connolly_(computer_scientist)\" title=\"Dan Connolly (computer scientist)\">Dan Connolly</a>, which included an SGML <a href=\"/wiki/Document_Type_Definition\" title=\"Document Type Definition\" class=\"mw-redirect\">Document Type Definition</a> to define the grammar.<sup id=\"cite_ref-9\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-9\"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> The draft expired after six months, but was notable for its acknowledgment of the <a href=\"/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)\" title=\"Mosaic (web browser)\">NCSA Mosaic</a> browser's custom tag for embedding in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards on successful prototypes.<sup id=\"cite_ref-raymond_10-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-raymond-10\"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Similarly, <a href=\"/wiki/Dave_Raggett\" title=\"Dave Raggett\">Dave Raggett</a>'s competing Internet-Draft, \"HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)\", from late 1993, suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and fill-out forms.<sup id=\"cite_ref-html.2B_11-0\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-html.2B-11\"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>\n",
    "<p>After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF created an HTML Working Group, which in 1995 completed \"HTML 2.0\", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a standard against which future implementations should be based.<sup id=\"cite_ref-12\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"#cite_note-12\"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>\n",

    "<p>Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by competing interests.
