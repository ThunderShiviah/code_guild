    "# Chapter 5. Saving User Input\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to take the to-do item input from the user and send it to the server, so that we can save it somehow and display it back to her later.\n",
    "\n",
    "As I started writing this chapter, I immediately skipped to what I thought was the right design: multiple models for lists and list items, a bunch of different URLs for adding new lists and items, three new view functions, and about half a dozen new unit tests for all of the above. But I stopped myself. Although I was pretty sure I was smart enough to handle all those problems at once, the point of TDD is to allow you to do one thing at a time, when you need to. So I decided to be deliberately short-sighted, and at any given moment only do what was necessary to get the functional tests a little further.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s a demonstration of how TDD can support an iterative style of development—it may not be the quickest route, but you do get there in the end. There’s a neat side benefit, which is that it allows me to introduce new concepts like models, dealing with POST requests, Django template tags, and so on one at a time rather than having to dump them on you all at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "None of this says that you shouldn’t try and think ahead, and be clever. In the next chapter we’ll use a bit more design and up-front thinking, and show how that fits in with TDD. But for now let’s plough on mindlessly and just do what the tests tell us to.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Wiring Up Our Form to Send a POST Request\n",
    "At the end of the last chapter, the tests were telling us we weren’t able to save the user’s input. For now, we’ll use a standard HTML POST request. A little boring, but also nice and easy to deliver—we can use all sorts of sexy HTML5 and JavaScript later in the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get our browser to send a POST request, we need to do two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "Give the `<input>` element a name= attribute\n",
    "Wrap it in a `<form>` tag with method=\"POST\".\n",

    "The unit-test/code cycle is sometimes taught as Red, Green, Refactor:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by writing a unit test which fails (Red).\n",
    "2. Write the simplest possible code to get it to pass (Green), even if that means cheating.\n",
    "3. Refactor to get to better code that makes more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what do we do during the Refactor stage? What justifies moving from an implementation where we \"cheat\" to one we’re happy with?\n",
    "\n",
    "One methodology is eliminate duplication: if your test uses a magic constant (like the \"1:\" in front of our list item), and your application code also uses it, that counts as duplication, so it justifies refactoring. Removing the magic constant from the application code usually means you have to stop cheating.\n",
    "\n",
    "I find that leaves things a little too vague, so I usually like to use a second technique, which is called triangulation: if your tests let you get away with writing \"cheating\" code that you’re not happy with, like returning a magic constant, write another test that forces you to write some better code. That’s what we’re doing when we extend the FT to check that we get a \"2:\" when inputting a second list item.\n",
    "Now we get to the self.fail('Finish the test!'). If we extend our FT to check for adding a second item to the table (copy and paste is our friend), we begin to see that our first cut solution really isn’t going to, um, cut it:\n",

    "## Three Strikes and Refactor\n",
    "Before we go further—we’ve got a bad code smell[7] in this FT. We have three almost identical code blocks checking for new items in the list table. There’s a principle called don’t repeat yourself (DRY), which we like to apply by following the mantra three strikes and refactor. You can copy and paste code once, and it may be premature to try and remove the duplication it causes, but once you get three occurrences, it’s time to remove duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by committing what we have so far. Even though we know our site has a major flaw—it can only handle one list item—it’s still further ahead than it was. We may have to rewrite it all, and we may not, but the rule is that before you do any refactoring, always do a commit:\n",

    "```\n",
    "Back to our functional test refactor: we could use an inline function, but that upsets the flow of the test slightly. Let’s use a helper method—remember, only methods that begin with test_ will get run as tests, so you can use other methods for your own purposes:\n",

    "And back to work. If we’re ever going to handle more than one list item, we’re going to need some kind of persistence, and databases are a stalwart solution in this area.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Django ORM and Our First Model\n",
    "An Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) is a layer of abstraction for data stored in a database with tables, rows, and columns. It lets us work with databases using familiar object-oriented metaphors which work well with code. Classes map to database tables, attributes map to columns, and an individual instance of the class represents a row of data in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django comes with an excellent ORM, and writing a unit test that uses it is actually an excellent way of learning it, since it exercises code by specifying how we want it to work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s create a new class in lists/tests.py:\n",
    "\n",
    "lists/tests.py. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from lists.models import Item\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "\n",
    "class ItemModelTest(TestCase):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def test_saving_and_retrieving_items(self):\n",
    "        first_item = Item()\n",
    "        first_item.text = 'The first (ever) list item'\n",
    "        first_item.save()\n",
    "\n",
    "        second_item = Item()\n",
    "        second_item.text = 'Item the second'\n",
    "        second_item.save()\n",
    "\n",
    "        saved_items = Item.objects.all()\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(saved_items.count(), 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "        first_saved_item = saved_items[0]\n",
    "        second_saved_item = saved_items[1]\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(first_saved_item.text, 'The first (ever) list item')\n",
    "        self.assertEqual(second_saved_item.text, 'Item the second')\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can see that creating a new record in the database is a relatively simple matter of creating an object, assigning some attributes, and calling a `.save()` function. Django also gives us an API for querying the database via a class attribute, .objects, and we use the simplest possible query, `.all()`, which retrieves all the records for that table. The results are returned as a list-like object called a QuerySet, from which we can extract individual objects, and also call further functions, like .count(). We then check the objects as saved to the database, to check whether the right information was saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django’s ORM has many other helpful and intuitive features; this might be a good time to skim through the Django tutorial, which has an excellent intro to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve written this unit test in a very verbose style, as a way of introducing the Django ORM. You can actually write a much shorter test for a model class, which we’ll see later on, in Chapter 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology 2: Unit Tests Versus Integrated Tests, and the Database\n",
    "Purists will tell you that a \"real\" unit test should never touch the database, and that the test I’ve just written should be more properly called an integrated test, because it doesn’t only test our code, but also relies on an external system, ie a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s OK to ignore this distinction for now—we have two types of test, the high-level functional tests which test the application from the user’s point of view, and these lower-level tests which test it from the programmer’s point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll come back to this and talk about unit tests and integrated tests in Chapter 19, towards the end of the book.\n",
    "Let’s try running the unit test. Here comes another unit-test/code cycle:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ImportError: cannot import name 'Item'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Very well, let’s give it something to import from lists/models.py. We’re feeling confident so we’ll skip the Item = None step, and go straight to creating a class:\n",
    "\n",
    "lists/models.py. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Item(object):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "That gets our test as far as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    first_item.save()\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",
    "AttributeError: 'Item' object has no attribute 'save'\n",
    "```\n",
    "To give our Item class a save method, and to make it into a real Django model, we make it inherit from the Model class:\n",
    "\n",
    "lists/models.py. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "from django.db import models\n",
    "\n",
    "class Item(models.Model):\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Our First Database Migration\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing that happens is a database error:\n",
    "```\n",
    "django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such table: lists_item\n",
    "```\n",
    "In Django, the ORM’s job is to model the database, but there’s a second system that’s in charge of actually building the database called migrations. Its job is to give you the ability to add and remove tables and columns, based on changes you make to your models.py files.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to think of it is as a version control system for your database. As we’ll see later, it comes in particularly useful when we need to upgrade a database that’s deployed on a live server.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now all we need to know is how to build our first database migration, which we do using the makemigrations command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python3 manage.py makemigrations\n",
    "Migrations for 'lists':\n",
    "  0001_initial.py:\n",
    "    - Create model Item\n",
    "$ ls lists/migrations\n",
    "0001_initial.py  __init__.py  __pycache__\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you’re curious, you can go and take a look in the migrations file, and you’ll see it’s a representation of our additions to models.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, we should find our tests get a little further.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Test Gets Surprisingly Far\n",
    "\n",
    "The test actually gets surprisingly far:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python3 manage.py test lists\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "    self.assertEqual(first_saved_item.text, 'The first (ever) list item')\n",
    "AttributeError: 'Item' object has no attribute 'text'\n",
    "```\n",
    "That’s a full eight lines later than the last failure—we’ve been all the way through saving the two Items, we’ve checked they’re saved in the database, but Django just doesn’t seem to have remembered the .text attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incidentally, if you’re new to Python, you might have been surprised we were allowed to assign the .text attribute at all. In something like Java, that would probably give you a compilation error. Python is more relaxed about things like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes that inherit from models.Model map to tables in the database. By default they get an auto-generated id attribute, which will be a primary key column in the database, but you have to define any other columns you want explicitly. Here’s how we set up a text field:\n",
    "\n",
    "lists/models.py. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Item(models.Model):\n",
    "    text = models.TextField()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Django has many other field types, like IntegerField, CharField, DateField, and so on. I’ve chosen TextField rather than CharField because the latter requires a length restriction, which seems arbitrary at this point. You can read more on field types in the Django tutorial and in the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A New Field Means a New Migration\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the tests gives us another database error:\n",
    "```\n",
    "django.db.utils.OperationalError: no such column: lists_item.text\n",
    "```\n",
    "It’s because we’ve added another new field to our database, which means we need to create another migration. Nice of our tests to let us know!\n",

    "Let’s try it:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python3 manage.py makemigrations\n",
    "You are trying to add a non-nullable field 'text' to item without a default; we\n",
    "can't do that (the database needs something to populate existing rows).\n",
    "Please select a fix:\n",
    " 1) Provide a one-off default now (will be set on all existing rows)\n",
    " 2) Quit, and let me add a default in models.py\n",
    "Select an option:2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Ah. It won’t let us add the column without a default value. Let’s pick option 2 and set a default in models.py. I think you’ll find the syntax reasonably self-explanatory:\n",
    "\n",
    "lists/models.py. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Item(models.Model):\n",
    "    text = models.TextField(default='')\n",
    "```\n",

    "Migrations for 'lists':\n",
    "  0002_item_text.py:\n",

    "```\n",
    "So, two new lines in models.py, two database migrations, and as a result, the .text attribute on our model objects is now recognised as a special attribute, so it does get saved to the database, and the tests pass…\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ python3 manage.py test lists\n",
    "[...]\n",
    "\n",
    "Ran 4 tests in 0.010s\n",
