    "In fact, as I was writing this my first instinct was to dive in and change the test first—make it use the render_to_string function straight away, delete the three superfluous assertions, leaving just a check of the contents against the expected render, and then go ahead and make the code change. But notice how that actually would have left space for me to break things: I could have defined the template as containing any arbitrary string, instead of the string with the right `<html>` and `<title>` tags.\n",

    "When refactoring, work on either the code or the tests, but not both at once.\n",
    "There’s always a tendency to skip ahead a couple of steps, to make a couple of tweaks to the behaviour while you’re refactoring, but pretty soon you’ve got changes to half a dozen different files, you’ve totally lost track of where you are, and nothing works any more. If you don’t want to end up like Refactoring Cat (below), stick to small steps; keep refactoring and functionality changes entirely separate.\n",
