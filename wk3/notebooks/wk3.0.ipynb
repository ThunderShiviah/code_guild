    "# Incremental development\n",
    "\n",
    "The key aspects of the process are:\n",
    "1. Start with a working skeleton program and make small incremental changes. At any point, if there is an error, you will know exactly where it is.\n",
    "2. Use temporary variables to refer to intermediate values so that you can easily inspect and check them.\n",
    "3. Once the program is working, relax, sit back, and play around with your options. (There is interesting research that links “playfulness” to better understanding, better learning, more enjoyment, and a more positive mindset about what you can achieve — so spend some time fiddling around!) You might want to consolidate multiple statements into one bigger compound expression, or rename the variables you’ve used, or see if you can make the function shorter. A good guideline is to aim for making code as easy as possible for others to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Debugging\n",
    "Another powerful technique for debugging (an alternative to single-stepping and inspection of program variables), is to insert extra print functions in carefully selected places in your code. Then, by inspecting the output of the program, you can check whether the algorithm is doing what you expect it to. Be clear about the following, however:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You must have a clear solution to the problem, and must know what should happen before you can debug a program. Work on solving the problem on a piece of paper (perhaps using a flowchart to record the steps you take) before you concern yourself with writing code. Writing a program doesn’t solve the problem — it simply automates the manual steps you would take. So first make sure you have a pen-and-paper manual solution that works. Programming then is about making those manual steps happen automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do not write **chatterbox functions**. A chatterbox is a fruitful function that, in addition to its primary task, also asks the user for input, or prints output, when it would be more useful if it simply shut up and did its work quietly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we’ve seen built-in functions like range, max and abs. None of these would be useful building blocks for other programs if they prompted the user for input, or printed their results while they performed their tasks.\n",
    "So a good tip is to avoid calling print and input functions inside fruitful functions, unless the primary purpose of your function is to perform input and output. The one exception to this rule might be to temporarily sprinkle some calls to print into your code to help debug and understand what is happening when the code runs, but these will then be removed once you get things working.\n",
